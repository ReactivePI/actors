# Actor library for Reactive PI

Reactive PI is a library based on akka and scala that allows developers to
use the various I/O ports on their raspberry PI from Scala.

The actors package allows the use of various ports on your Raspberry PI in your
Akka based application.

The core library can be used standalone in your application. You don't need
to use Akka if you don't want to. So if you're not interested in Akka support,
check out the core library.
